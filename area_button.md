## How to hide/disable entities?
Go into Edit Mode and select the entity you want to change. Click on hide/disable entity in DD.
<br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64064679/163055979-df7511c4-aa08-4f48-8988-907d614baa8c.png)

Hidden or disabled entities will show on the bottom page when you are in edit mode.
You can unhide or enable entities if you accidently disabled/hid them.

The difference between hiding and disabling is that hidden entities are still used in DD3. For example if you hide temperature or humidity entities they still are used for temperature or humidity calculation. 
Disabling this will completely disable the calculation and the entity wont show.

## How to change width of cards?

Go into Edit Mode and select the entity you want to change. Click on entity settings or for custom cards click on Edit.

Default size is for small devices like smartphones or tablets.

## How to change the device page?

The device page shows all entity domains you have in your Home Assistant setup. You can drag the devices the way you want when you are in Edit Mode.
From Edit Mode you can also change the icons or add it to the main navigation bar 
<br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64064679/163205930-722775af-87c0-43e2-94ed-376b034d2754.png)

You will see all devices of an entity domain (like media player or switch). You can group them by rooms if you want.
You can also edit cards or blueprints into device views like you can do in areas.

Hiding/Disabling works also from here because these states work for whole DD3. You can unhide/enable these entities from here, too.

## Using Blueprints
After installing blueprints you can add your blueprints to your dashboards.

There a 3 common blueprint types.
1. Card Blueprints
2. Page Blueprints
3. Replace Card Blueprints

You can add card blueprints into areas (rooms), page blueprints into more pages and you can change the card type of an existing entity with a replace card.

The steps are ther same for every blueprint type.

Go into Edit Mode and add a new card/page.
Choose Dwains Dashboard Blueprint and click on Use This Blueprint.

## Updating Blueprints

When there is a new version of the blueprint released you can simply follow the same steps as improting a blueprint.
The files will automatically change. After importing the new verison of the blueprint you need to apply it on the card/page where you are using the old version.
Therefore you go into edit mode and edit the card/page. Wait a moment and the new version will be loaded. Then submit changes and the new blueprint is used.
